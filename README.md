# Plan Capsule

>It's like a time capsule for your plans!

Little command-line utility for quickly writing down the brilliant ideas you come up with when you have much more pressing things to be doing. Open it up,
add your new plan, and go back to whatever you were doing. Then, sometime in the future, you can open up your list and come back to it.

Not recommended for use in the shower.

## To-do

* add `bin/plancapsule` so that it can be called without using `node index.js`
* add "help" command that lists args
* Publish to npm
